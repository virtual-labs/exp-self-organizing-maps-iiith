Observe the performance of self-organizing map for travelling salesman problem for the following conditions:
- Number of cities = 100 and number of neurons in the output layer = 2000
- Number of cities = 100 and number of neurons in the output layer = 50
- In each case, compute the number of cities that have not been visited even once.
- Plot the percentage of cities visited, as a function of the number of iterations in either cases.
