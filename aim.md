The objective of this experiment is to provide a suboptimal solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), using the properties of self-organization feature maps (SOM). The focus is:
- To illustrate the principle of self-organization for addressing the travelling salesman problem
- To observe the suboptimal nature of the solution provided by SOM
- To study the effect of structure of SOM on the solution
